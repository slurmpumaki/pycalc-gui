# 🧮 safe-pycalc

Just a simple calculator I built with Python and Tkinter.  
I wanted to make something that looks clean, works smoothly,  
and safely handles calculations without using `eval()`.

## ✨ What it does
- Basic math functions (+, −, ×, ÷, %, **, //)
- Clean GUI using Tkinter
- Keyboard and mouse input support
- Handles errors nicely (no crashes!)

## 🚀 To run it
```bash
python calculator.py
